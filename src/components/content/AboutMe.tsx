        About Me
      </h2>

      <p className="text-base text-gray-400">
        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <strong>{siteConfig.author}</strong>, and I've been
        passionate about coding since I was a child. I fell in love with
        programming at a young age, spending countless hours learning,
        experimenting, and creating small projects. Over the years, this passion
        has grown into a career as a Full Stack developer, where I continue to
        build innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base text-gray-400 mt-4">
        As Iâ€™ve evolved in my career, Iâ€™ve expanded my expertise into new areas
        like Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), diving deep
        into neural networks and other cutting-edge technologies. But no matter
        how much I learn, I always keep that same excitement and curiosity I had
        as a child, exploring new fields and technologies that push the
        boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base text-gray-400 mt-4">
        Today, Iâ€™m not just focused on building apps and websites; Iâ€™m also
        exploring DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS to optimize and
        scale my projects. I believe in continuous learning and growth, and Iâ€™m
        always looking for new challenges that help me expand my skills.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base text-gray-400 mt-4">
        If youâ€™re interested in collaborating on something exciting or need help
        with a project, feel free to reach out. Letâ€™s create something amazing
        together!
